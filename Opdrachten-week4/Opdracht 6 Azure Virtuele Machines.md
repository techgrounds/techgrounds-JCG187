To protect against localized hardware failures, such as a disk or network switch failing, deploy two or more VMs in an availability set. An availability set consists of two or more fault domains that share a common power source and network switch. VMs in an availability set are distributed across the fault domains, so if a hardware failure affects one fault domain, network traffic can still be routed to the VMs in the other fault domains. For more information about Availability Sets, see Manage the availability of Windows virtual machines in Azure.
