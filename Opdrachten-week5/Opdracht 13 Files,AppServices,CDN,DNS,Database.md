Mobile backends: This is the server-side infrastructure that provides functionality and data storage for mobile applications. It's where the data and logic for an app live and it's responsible for handling tasks such as user authentication, data storage and retrieval, and push notifications.

RESTful APIs:  (Application Programming Interfaces) are a way for mobile apps to communicate with a backend server over the internet. APIs provide a set of standardized rules and protocols for accessing data and functionality from a server, making it easier for developers to build apps that can work with different backends.

Think of it like ordering food at a restaurant: the mobile app is like the customer, and the mobile backend is like the kitchen. The RESTful API is like the menu that tells the kitchen what the customer wants, and then the kitchen prepares the food and sends it back to the customer. In the same way, the mobile app sends requests to the backend server through the RESTful API, and then the server processes the requests and sends back the necessary data and functionality to the app.



 **Azure DNS**  

 Allows for translation of domain names to IP addresses that can be used to access resources in the cloud. You can use Azure DNS service to manage DNS records for your domain names. 

 public zones for internet facing resources and private zones for the internal resources in a vnet are supported. The internal resources are not accessible from the internet.
