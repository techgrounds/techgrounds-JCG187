// Application Gateway uses a rule to specify how to direct the messages that it receives on its incoming port to the servers in the back-end pool. If the servers are using TLS/SSL, you must configure the rule to indicate:

//     That the servers expect traffic through the HTTPS protocol.
//     Which certificate to use to encrypt traffic and authenticate the connection to a server.



// Application Gateway routing

// When the gateway routes a client request to a web server in the back-end pool, it uses a set of rules configured for the gateway to determine where the request should go. 
// There are two primary methods of routing this client request traffic: path-based routing and multiple-site routing.

// Path-based routing

// Path-based routing sends requests with different URL paths to different pools of back-end servers. For example, you could direct requests with the 
// path /video/* to a back-end pool containing servers that are optimized to handle video streaming, and direct /images/* requests to a pool of servers that handle image retrieval.

// Multiple-site routing

// Multiple-site routing configures more than one web application on the same Application Gateway instance. In a multi-site configuration, you register multiple DNS names (CNAMEs) for 
// the IP address of the application gateway, specifying the name of each site. Application Gateway uses separate listeners to wait for requests for each site. 
// Each listener passes the request to a different rule, which can route the requests to servers in a different back-end pool. For example, you could direct all requests 
// for http://contoso.com to servers in one back-end pool, and requests for http://fabrikam.com to another back-end pool. The following diagram shows this configuration:

// TLS/SSL termination

// When you terminate the TLS/SSL connection at the application gateway, it offloads the CPU-intensive TLS/SSL termination workload from your servers. Also, you donâ€™t need to 
// install certificates and configure TLS/SSL on your servers.

// If you need end-to-end encryption, Application Gateway can decrypt the traffic on the gateway by using your private key, then re-encrypt again with the public key of the 
// service running in the back-end pool.

// Traffic enters the gateway through a front-end port. You can open many ports, and Application Gateway can receive messages on any of these ports. A listener is the first 
// thing that your traffic meets when entering the gateway through a port. It's set up to listen for a specific host name, and a specific port on a specific IP address. 
// The listener can use an TLS/SSL certificate to decrypt the traffic that enters the gateway. The listener then uses a rule that you define to direct the 
// incoming requests to a back-end pool.

// Health probes

// Health probes determine which servers are available for load-balancing in a back-end pool. The Application Gateway uses a health probe to send a request to a server. 
// When the server returns an HTTP response with a status code between 200 and 399, the server is considered healthy. If you don't configure a health probe, 
// Application Gateway creates a default probe that waits for 30 seconds before deciding that a server is unavailable. Health probes ensure that traffic isn't 
// being directed to a back-end pool web endpoint that is non-responsive for has failed.
